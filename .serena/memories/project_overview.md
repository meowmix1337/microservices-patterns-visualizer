# Project Overview

## Project Name
**microservices-patterns-visualizer** (Communication Patterns Visualizer)

## Purpose
An interactive React application for visualizing and understanding distributed system communication patterns. It's an educational tool that brings distributed systems concepts to life through interactive, animated visualizations.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Animated message flows, state changes, and failure scenarios
- **Multiple Patterns**: Async Microservices, Request-Response (with more coming: Saga, CQRS, Circuit Breaker)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live cache/queue contents, event logs, service status indicators
- **Educational Focus**: Step-by-step explanations, adjustable animation speed, scenario controls
- **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism design, dark theme, responsive layout, smooth Framer Motion animations

## Target Audience
- Students learning microservices architecture
- Teachers/presenters explaining system design
- Developers exploring communication patterns
- Anyone wanting to understand distributed systems visually

## Current Version
- Version: 2.0.0
- Status: Production Ready
- Last Updated: 2025-11-14

## Pattern Categories
1. **Asynchronous Patterns**: Event-driven architecture with cache-aside pattern
2. **Synchronous Patterns**: Simple HTTP request-response communication
3. **Hybrid Patterns** (coming soon): CQRS
4. **Resilience Patterns** (coming soon): Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, Retry

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Cache-aside pattern (lazy loading)
- Event-driven updates
- Synchronous fallback
- Circuit breaker for fault tolerance
- Graceful degradation
- Eventual consistency
- Consumer lag simulation
